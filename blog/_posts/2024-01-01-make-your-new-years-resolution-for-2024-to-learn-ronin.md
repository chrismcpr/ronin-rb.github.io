title: Make your New Year's Resolution for 2024 to try Ronin
author: postmodern

The other day I noticed someone in a popular InfoSec certification Discord
server asking if anyone else had used [Ronin](/). They said that Ronin looked
interesting, but were unsure whether they should take the risk to learn a new
tool. 

Each new year people make New Year's Resolutions to try new things or to better
themselves. For 2024 why not make your New Year's Resolution to try Ronin?
Browse the [GitHub organization][ronin-rb] and checkout the various
repositories. Read the example commands and code in their `README`s.
Try [installing Ronin][install] using the
[automatic installer script][ronin-install.sh]. Try running some of the
`ronin` commands. Use the `ronin tips` command to learn about Ruby's commands
and Ruby scripting APIs. Use `--help` to open a command's man page and see it's
options. Don't want to install Ronin directly on to your system, there's also
[Docker images] you can jump into. Now has never been a better time to try
Ronin.

Even if you end up not liking Ronin, you can always uninstall it and forget
about it. So why not give Ronin a shot in 2024? You don't have anything to lose.
