[ronin-db][ronin-db] [0.1.3][ronin-db-0.1.3],
[ronin-exploits][ronin-exploits] [1.0.4][ronin-exploits-1.0.4], and
[ronin-support][ronin-support] [1.0.5][ronin-support-1.0.5]
have been released. These new releases are patch releases and contain minor
bug fixes and improvements to the documentation. Most notably [ronin-db-0.1.3]
contains a fix for a bug in the `ronin-db add` command when ran for the first
time, which a new user (`@shellspawn`) had discovered. Also,
[ronin-support-1.0.5] fixes a Ruby 3.3.0 specific bug, so it should be safe to
use Ronin with the brand new [Ruby 3.3.0] now.
